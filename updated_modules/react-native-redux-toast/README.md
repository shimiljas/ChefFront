## Installation

#### npm
```bash
npm install --save react-native-redux-toast
```

#### yarn
```bash
yarn add react-native-redux-toast
```

## Usage

1- Add the toast reducer to your store

```js
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { toastReducer as toast } from 'react-native-redux-toast';

const reducers = combineReducers({
  toast
});

export default createStore(reducers);
```

2- Mount the toast component where you want to use it. (Usually at the root level of the app)

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { Toast } from 'react-native-redux-toast';

import store from './store';
import App from './app';

export default function main() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <App />
        <Toast messageStyle={{ color: 'white' }} />
      </View>
    </Provider>
  );
}

```

3- Dispatch actions

```js
class App extends Component {
  displayErrorToast = () => {
    this.props.dispatch(ToastActionsCreators.displayError('Error toast!'));
  };

  displayWarningToast = () => {
    this.props.dispatch(ToastActionsCreators.displayWarning('Warning toast!', 2000));
  };

  displayInfoToast = () => {
    this.props.dispatch(ToastActionsCreators.displayInfo('Info toast!', 5000));
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Button title={'Info Toast!'} onPress={this.displayInfoToast} />
        <Button title={'Warning Toast!'} onPress={this.displayWarningToast} />
        <Button title={'Error Toast!'} onPress={this.displayErrorToast} />
      </View>
    );
  }
}

```
